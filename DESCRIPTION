Description: The package supports functions that show the Adhan (i.e. islamic prayer) 
	times. It uses the API supported by https://aladhan.com/, so the user should 
	be connected to the Internet. Additionally Adhan package also provides tools 
	to map a prayer time in a city (e.g. Mecca) to that of another city (e.g. 
	Helsinki) whilst estimating all the praying times in the latter (i.e. 
	Helsinki) based on the prayer times in the former (i.e. Mecca). This is 
	useful for those who live in cities with very long nights/days and wish to 
	follow prayer times of another city.
